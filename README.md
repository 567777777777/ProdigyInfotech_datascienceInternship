Welcome to my internship task repository! This README file provides an overview of the tasks completed during the internship program.

# Task Descriptions

# Task-01: Visualizing Distribution of a Variable

- Objective: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
- Steps:
  - Identify the variable of interest.
  - Choose appropriate visualization techniques (bar chart for categorical, histogram for continuous).
  - Generate the visualization using Python libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn.

# Task-02: Building a Decision Tree Classifier

- Objective: Build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data.
- Steps:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset.
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Build and train a decision tree classifier model.
  - Evaluate the model's performance and report accuracy metrics.

# Task-03: Analyzing and Visualizing Sentiment Patterns

- Objective: Analyze sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes.
- Steps:
  - Perform sentiment analysis on social media data using NLP techniques.
  - Visualize sentiment distributions and patterns using matplotlib or seaborn.
  - Interpret visualizations to gain insights into public opinion.

# Task-04: Analyzing Traffic Accident Data

- Objective: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- Steps:
  - Load and preprocess the traffic accident dataset.
  - Analyze patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
  - Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using appropriate plots.


#Conclusion

Completing these tasks during my internship at [Prodigy_Infotech] provided me with valuable hands-on experience in data visualization and machine learning. I gained proficiency in data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and building predictive models using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These tasks enhanced my skills and knowledge in data science and prepared me for future projects and challenges in the field.
